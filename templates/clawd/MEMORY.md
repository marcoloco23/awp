# Long-Term Memory

*Curated memories, lessons learned, and important context that persists across sessions.*

## About This File

This is your long-term memory — the distilled essence of what matters, not raw logs. Daily logs go in `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`.

### What to Record Here

- Important decisions and their reasoning
- Lessons learned from mistakes
- Key context about ongoing projects
- User preferences and working styles
- Significant events worth remembering

### What NOT to Record Here

- Routine task logs (those go in daily files)
- Secrets or sensitive credentials
- Raw conversation transcripts
- Temporary information
